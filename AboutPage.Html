              I know a lot of people my be wondering why I chose to use the
              topic (Father) as the first topic for my hobbies. Well I'll
              explain it, its quite simple in fact. The Definition of a hobby is
              an activity done regularly in one's leisure tire for pleasure.
              Which is exacly why i pick this for my first topic. My Daughter
              Bella who is three as of right now is hands down one of the best
              things that has happen to me. she brings me joy , makes me laugh ,
              became my bestfriend in these three short years and pushes my to
              be the best person/father that i can ever hope to be.
