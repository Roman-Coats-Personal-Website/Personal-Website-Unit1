            With this being week one of my journey of becoming a sucsessful Developer.
          I was eager to get my feet wet and see what I was going to learn. This website was to
        do just that. We got introduced to HyperText Markup Language also known as HTML, we were introduced to
        Cascading Style Sheet aka CSS. It was pretty basic when we first started, but the 
    more the Professor spoke and the more I toyed around inside VS code, the more I saw the sky was the limit
     and there was so much to learn and some much that code be done while coding </p>

  We emphasized ket concepts learned during the first two weeks.
  these included essentials HTML semantics tags such as Headers, Footer, 
  Article, Section, and Summary, Which are the fondation of frontend development.
  Additionally, we focused on pratical skills like inserting images, integrating 
  list, and utilizing various headers levels (h1-h6).

        For my third project the goal was to create an HTML file that has food photos, different 
        categories of grocery items and list the different items. Some of the Requirments I was to meet are as follows
        incorporate the major hmtl semantic tags. sections should have background colors. Inlcude three types of headings as well
        as two type of of list.CSS needs to be incorporated using an external CSS file, internal in the header, and inline. You 
        choose which CSS goes where. I feel as if I met all of the requirments and i great imporvment in my work as this course go on.
