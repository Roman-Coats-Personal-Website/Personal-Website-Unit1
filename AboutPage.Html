              I know a lot of people my be wondering why I chose to use the
              topic (Father) as the first topic for my hobbies. Well I'll
              explain it, its quite simple in fact. The Definition of a hobby is
              an activity done regularly in one's leisure time for pleasure.
              Which is exacly why I pick this for my first topic. My Daughter
              Bella who is three as of right now, is hands down one of the best
              things that has happen to me. She brings me joy , makes me laugh
              and became my bestfriend in these three short years. She pushes me
              to be the best person/father that I can ever hope to be.

            Fishing is a hobby enjoyed be people of all ages. Fishing enthusiast
            all fish for diffrent reasons. there are those that fish for the
            thrill and the challenge that actually come along with catching a
            Fish. While on the other hand others fish for the relaxation of it
            all. i fall somewhere in the middle. The thought of casting my rod
            and not knowing what kind or how big the next fish be. At the Same
            time just the thought of being outside in nature hearing the sound
            of water, the wind blowing , and birds chirping that gives me a
            serious sense of peace.

          This may be last on my list but between Fishing and Football its a
          hard tie on which one I would say I like more. Seeing they're both two
          thing I've been doing since I was at least 5 years old. But football
          brings a diffrent type of comfort to the table. Football is one thing
          I can talk about for hours, with family and friends. Which is one of
          the reasons I love it so much. Not only playing but the camaraderie of
          being a part of a team. The unbreakable bond that was built with the
          coaches and team mates is something that i will carry with me for
          life.
