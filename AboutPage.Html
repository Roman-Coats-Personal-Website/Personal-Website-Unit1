                I know a lot of people my be wondering why I chose to use the
                topic (Father) as the first topic for my hobbies. Well I'll
                explain it, its quite simple in fact. The Definition of a hobby
                is an activity done regularly in one's leisure tire for
                pleasure. Which is exacly why i pick this for my first topic. My
                Daughter Bella who is three as of right now is hands down one of
                the best things that has happen to me. she brings me joy , makes
                me laugh , became my bestfriend in these three short years and
                pushes my to be the best person/father that i can ever hope to
                be.

              Lot of people enjoy fishing seeing it is one hobby that can be
              partaking in by people of all ages. With that being said everybody
              enjoys fishing for diffent reasons. Some People fish for the
              thrill and the challege that comes with actually catching a fish.
              while one the other hand some people fish in order to relax and
              clear their mind. I Fall somewhere in the middle, I love casting
              my rod and not knowing what kind or how big the next fish I'm
              going to pull up is going to be . At the Same time just the
              thought outside in nature hearing the sound of water, the wind
              blowing , and birds chirping that gives me a serious sense of
              peace.
